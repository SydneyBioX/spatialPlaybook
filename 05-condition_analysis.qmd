# Differential Analysis

Steps: 

1.    Differential proportions of cells (spicyR::getProp)
2.    Differential localisation of cells (spicyR)
3.    Differential region proportions (lisaClust)
4.    Differential localisation of cells with respect to a parent (Kontextual)
5.    Differential cell-cell interactions (SpatioMark)
