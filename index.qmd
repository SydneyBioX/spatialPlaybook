Recent advances in highly multiplexed cell imaging technologies—such as PhenoCycler, IMC, CosMx, Xenium, and MERFISH—have fundamentally transformed our ability to study complex cellular relationships within tissues. While traditional immunohistochemistry protocols were limited to visualising cells based on just two or three surface proteins, these cutting-edge technologies can now characterise cells using over 50 proteins or thousands of RNA molecules in situ. This breakthrough enables precise classification of cell subtypes and offers an unprecedented view of cellular heterogeneity in tissue environments.

To fully leverage this potential, novel analytical appraoches are essential—not just new methods, but also a clear understanding of when and where to apply them. In this playbook, we guide researchers through key decisions in spatial omics analysis, aligning analytical strategies with biological questions, tissue structure, and data characteristics. While we highlight packages developed within the [**scdney**](https://sydneybiox.github.io/scdney/) ecosystem and provide recommended workflows, the primary aim is not to prescribe a single path. Instead, we focus on introducing the common challenges, trade-offs, and considerations that shape analysis choices—emphasising interpretation, reproducibility, and ultimately, the biological insights that emerge from spatial data.

The playbook is organised around a flexible, seven-stage analytical workflow designed to accommodate a range of imaging technologies and biological contexts:

1.  Cell segmentation and pre-processing
2.  Quality control and normalisation
3.  Cell clustering/annotation
4.  Quantifying co-localisation between cell types
5.  Identifying spatial domains
6.  Measuring changes in marker expression
7.  Classification of patients to clinical outcomes

Rather than focusing on the specific technologies used, we encourage researchers to centre their analyses on the biological questions they aim to answer. By doing so, this framework helps ensure that analytical choices are guided by scientific goals and contextual knowledge, rather than technical convenience alone.
